Hello treasured friend. If you're reading this, it's probably because I've force-fed you a link after discussing your upcoming trip to Scotland. I hope this is useful to you in some way. Think of this a travel guide that you can dip into when you find yourself in one of these places either hungry or bored. I don't describe anything in detail, you'll just have to take me on my word that these places are worth visiting.

Before diving in, I'd like to make a quick overarching recommendation. If you only have one chance to visit, I would strongly advise using this visit to see Edinburgh in August for the [Fringe Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe). In general, you can't do better than Edinburgh; it's the capital, cultural centre, prettiest city; and in August you'll get the best weather. But the Fringe is a unique experience that I think should be on everyone's bucket list. Every pub, church, park, music venue (indeed, any open space) becomes a stage for artists, actors, and comedians. These artists range from world class to distinctly amateur, and the fun lies in booking a string of shows across an afternoon/evening, likely from performers you will never have heard of, and rolling the dice. You will see some awful shows that make you cringe, then you'll see a performance that will take your breath away leaving you in awe of their talent. The bars are open till 5am every day of the week (usually outlawed in Scotland), and the city is buzzing with excitement and energy. Edinburgh is the most cosmopolitan city in Scotland, but it is especially so for the Fringe, with  ~1 million tourists visiting. During my undergrad, I worked in different bars each Fringe I was there, so have seen plenty of it, and I promise you won't regret going, it's a special time.

Anyway, if you want to explore more than just the Fringe, here's some ideas of things to do. The two categories are: 1) Cities, 2) Special Events, and there's a little aside at the end on golf courses. I think the sub-structure is self-explanatory. I hope it's helpful!

# Special Events

## Edinburgh Fringe

### Venues to visit
- Pleasance Courtyard: high-quality comedy and drama and one of the cool old university buildings. The bars are sick too. [[map]](https://goo.gl/maps/nh83Py5T7N5Xdbgc8)
- Gilded Balloon: Similar to Pleasance, really cool old building with great acts performing every year. [[map]](https://goo.gl/maps/skjzcAoqYcY2XAJv8)
- The Stand: the best comedy club in Edinburgh [[map]](https://goo.gl/maps/oCiiZpTNv5nDGqAM8)

- Udderbelly: a large purple cow [map]](http://www.underbellyedinburgh.co.uk/#stq=&stp=1)

### Recurring shows to see
- Late n' Live: on every night in the Gilded Balloon from 1am. Different comedians are selected each evening to perform a set. They've already performed their usual, daily set earlier on, and have probably now had a few celebratory drinks. The crowd are equally loose and it creates a chaotic, hilarious atmosphere [[map]](https://latenlive.co.uk/about/)

## North Coast 500
If you're planning a road trip through the Highlands then you're probably familiar with the North Coast 500. You can't go wrong following [the intended route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast_500#:~:text=The%20North%20Coast%20500%20is,Scotland%20in%20one%20touring%20route.), but here's a little advice on places I think you should definitely visit on the way.
- Glenfinnan Viaduct: If you've seen Harry Potter then you'll recognise this as the bridge the train crosses en route to Hogwarts. It's beautiful, but works as a great spot to stop for lunch. [[map]](https://goo.gl/maps/A5LmFpunQxGNgU9P9)
- The [James Bond View](https://images.app.goo.gl/n6dZcDgixxPJad2r8) [[map]](https://goo.gl/maps/Yvm6WqbqDW3HLLGZA)

- The prettiest bit of road to drive is near Applecross [[map]](https://goo.gl/maps/gUFfQctdsUB9J168A)
- Get a flight to [Barra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barra_Airport) in the Outer Hebrides and land on the beach! [[map]](https://goo.gl/maps/27GKka1FZMAGK8QX7)
- Isle of Harris, and specifically [Luskentyre Beach](https://goo.gl/maps/wkoNLZcS1CpCdENM7)) [[map]](https://goo.gl/maps/wkoNLZcS1CpCdENM7)
- Take the [shortest commercial flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westray_to_Papa_Westray_flight#:~:text=The%20Loganair%20Westray%20to%20Papa,fastest%20flight%20is%2053%20seconds.) in the world from Westray to Papa Westray. It lasts 53 seconds. [[map]](https://goo.gl/maps/AkH13qdFuG4KXXHB9)
